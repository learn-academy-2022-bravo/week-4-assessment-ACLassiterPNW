# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are calls used to access data in a parent component from a child component. 

  Researched answer: Props allow us to pass data and methods between a parent component and child component using a component call, similarly to the way that a function is passed through an argument. 

2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event captures data on a webpage when a user interacts with it. For instance, if a user clicks a button on a webpage, a DOM event is triggered that allows us to see the occurence. 

  Researched answer: A DOM (Document Object Model) event is an interaction between a user and a web application, or, more specifically, the elements of the web application. An example of a DOM event would be a user moving their mouse across the screen, which results in the DOM displaying the cursor's position. 


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a type of programming that represents data as objects containing attributes. This is different than functional programming, as programs of this type are comprised of functions, rather than objects. 
  
  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a type of programming that is centered around objects (data) rather than functions and logic, whereas functional programming uses only functions. 


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: In Ruby, a Float is a decimal number, and an Integer is a whole, positive or negative number. 

  Researched answer: In Ruby, a Float is a number that contains a decimal, and an Integer is a whole number (one not containing a decimal). An integer can be positive or negative. 


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: The implicit return in Ruby means that we do not have to include a return keyword in our code because the return is implied. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return means that Ruby will return the value of the last executed instruction, whether or not we inclue the return keyword. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Used in OOP to give objects the space to store data. An instance variable is identified by the inclusion of an @ symbol before the variable name. Ex: @car

2. PostgreSQL: Also known as postgres, PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database management system that uses OOP to view databases. 

3. Ruby on Rails: A model-view controller (MVC) web application framework written in Ruby that provides default structures for web services, databases, and web pages. 

4. ORM: Stands for Object Relational Mapping. This is a technique that converts data between incompatible systems, allowing developers to write SQL queries using Rails. 

5. Active Record: A Rails ORM that takes data from a database table and allows us to interact with it like a Ruby oject.
